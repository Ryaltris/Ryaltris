**Aspiring Malware Analyst | Reverse Engineering Enthusiast | C & Low-Level Security Learner**

I'm a self-taught cybersecurity learner focused on building a career in offensive security, specifically in reverse engineering, exploit development, and malware tooling. My background includes hands-on learning of C programming, memory manipulation, and behavioral malware simulation. I'm currently building a personal toolkit and portfolio to demonstrate my growing skills in low-level systems programming and threat analysis.

---

## Focus Areas

- Malware analysis & behavior emulation
- Reverse engineering & binary analysis
- C programming & memory-level manipulation
- Exploit development (future focus)
- Building offensive security tools for good

---

## Current Projects

- **Malware Behavior Scanner (C):** A tool that scans user input strings for suspicious characters and reports them with a breakdown of letter/digit/other counts. This helps simulates the early behavior of malware signature detection.

- **Custom String Library (C):** Rebuilt functions like `strlen`, `strcpy`, `strcat`, and `strcmp` from scratch using pointer logic to strengthen understanding of memory and strings.

---

## Learning Goals

- Complete a self-driven Malware Simulator in C that mimics:
  - File manipulation
  - Process injection (simulated)
  - Network beaconing
- Understand and manipulate memory at a low level using pointers
- Begin writing C-based exploits and shellcode analysis
- Transition into using Python for automation and analysis workflows

---

## Long-Term Goal

To work in a specialized red-team, malware research, or national security-focused offensive security role.
